Focus on:
  * What went right?
  * What did you learn?
  * How could you have improved the experience?
  * What environmental factors contributed to the success/failure?
  * What went wrong, and how can you avoid these things in the future?
  * What questions did this project raise for you?
  
Avoid:
  * Blaming yourself, others, or the tools you used
  * Obviously negative statements like "I'm dumb" or "Because I'm an idiot"
  * Apologies ("I'm so sorry that I ...")
  
 If you can, include the following:
   * What concepts from this project do you now feel like you really know?
   * What concepts are still somewhat fuzzy for you?
   * What concepts seem like they're still out of reach?
   
Please turn this project in as a single .txt file using github, via the assignments portal.
